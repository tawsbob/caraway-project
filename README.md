## Caraway Challenge: E-commerce Product Listing Page
Objective: Update the product listing page using TypeScript, React, StyleX and Next.js.
The page should display a list of products grouped with the instructions on the page (see page.tsx)

- Use the static `data.json` file (do not edit)
- Use the example image attached to create the Product Card with the following properties
  - Hero Image
  - Title
  - Pricing
  - Add To Cart button (no functionality required)


#### Some things to keep in mind
 - You do not need to add any click functionality any component.
 - We want to see how far you can go and how you think about solving these problems.
 - Technical implementation is important.
 - You can use additional libraries.
 - Does not need to be mobile responsive. Some grid or container should be present
